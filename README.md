# Web-Server-CSE310
# This is web server that handles one HTTP request at a time. It can accept and parse the HTTP request, get the requested file from the server’s file system, create an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines, and then send the response directly to the client. (d) If the requested file is not present in the server, the server should send an HTTP “404 Not Found” message back to the client. To run the Server, an HTML file (e.g., HelloWorld.html) is in the same directory that the server is in. Determine the IP address of the host that is running the server (e.g., 128.238.251.26). From another host, open a browser and provide the corresponding URL. For example: http://128.238.251.26:6789/HelloWorld.html
